# Simple Calculator in C

This is a menu-driven simple calculator written in C by **KCPR**.[web:35]  
It performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers using a loop and a `switch`-based function.[web:35]

## Features

- Menu-driven interface in the terminal.[web:35]  
- Operations supported:
  - Addition  
  - Subtraction  
  - Multiplication  
  - Division (with divide-by-zero check)  
  - Modulus (integer remainder with divide-by-zero check)  
  - Power (using `pow` from `<math.h>`)[web:28]

- Uses `NAN` and `isnan()` to handle invalid operations.[web:28]

## Files

- `calculator.c` – contains the full source code for the calculator.[web:35]

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC).[web:33]  
- Standard headers: `stdio.h`, `math.h`.[web:28]
